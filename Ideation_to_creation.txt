hope -> insight -> confidence

Team:
forming -> storming -> norming -> performing -> adjourning, goto storming
adjourning will cut through the norms and enable higher performance level in the future
spark inspiration for new ideas

to move through the phases, create a sense of urgency
	- e. g. bring in an outsider; have crisis; culture of change; address the nay-sayers (those without a sense of urgency)
	
create DiagnosticSuppressors for annoying warnings
why act today?
	- useful for a lot of people
	- noone else has done it before
	- can have IDE0058 suggestions as warnings again
	
1. urgency: why act now
2. team: build guiding coalition (who is on our team, who is going to champion our success?)
	- Andrii
	- Jeremy
	- Arno
	- David
	- Alex Probst
	
	- Katharina (emotional support)
	
	- Sandrine / other recruiters 
	- mcyntire123

3. expectation: What are our team expectations going to be (can be done before, in the middle and in the retro (or all))
	8 box challenge
	- create the actual product of course
	- makes common expectations clear
	- make different expectations of others visible
	- compare my own expectations (that maybe I think others have of me) to the actual expecations of others
	also: how can we parlay succes in one project to the next project?

4. plan: What is success going to look like? What needs to be accomplished to reach that goal?
	- what can lead to success? prioritize and place weight
	
	- have it work with stringbuilder
	- have it work with custom-defined methods (on .editorconfig)
	- unit-test it
	- create a template for unit-testing a DiagnosticSuppressor
	- write blog entries about it
	- auto-recognize fluent APIs
	
5. communicate:
right message in the right way at the right time to the right audience
understand complexity and emotion
communicating complex idea by email for the first time may be sabotaging it
if idea requires discussion or stirs emotions, then create more personal communication with short feedback loop (e. g. chat, video conference)

6. empower: empower action
if you can implement your ideas all on your own, then your ideas are too small ;-)
empower others to help implement your ideas
